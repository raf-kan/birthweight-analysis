# birthweight-analysis

### Hello
This basic projects was put togther to highlight the principles of analysis I learned through data analysis in University and additional courses afetwards.

### The Data
"data_birthweight.xlsx" is a file on data between the birthweight of a new born child alongside the info on the parent's "habits", such as smoking and drinking.

### The Analysis
Under the analysis section of the code, I start of by finding key information on the "birthweight" column of data. Mainly, the mean, median, and mode.
This is then followed up by the *.describe()* function to tell me variance in the data, min and max, kurtois, and skewness.
To test the correlation between the *birthweight* and other columns, a *.cor()* test was done and put through a heatmap for a visual representations.
Specifically I am looking at the *birthweight* column, therefere after analysing the heatmap, I call the column where the *birthweight* correlation is showned against each variable.
